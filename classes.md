Currently, Gayle and Erika are providing training in foundational skills for beginning agility handler-dog 
teams, with a focus on safety, positivity, and thoroughness.

Class sessions are one hour in length, and are once per week for six weeks, for a fee of $90.00.  No more 
than six teams are enrolled in each class.  To facilitate success, handlers must be willing to practice with 
their dogs outside of class sessions.

In order to be enrolled in classes, dogs must be current on rabies vaccinations and non-aggressive 
around other dogs and humans.  All dogs must be crated during class sessions, except when working or 
entering/leaving the field.
